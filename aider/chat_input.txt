+/architect Currently to use the app, user will have to click `Start Recording` then talk then `Stop Recording`. Only then will backend process the audio and transform speech to text and display the text on the frontend. What i would like to do is click `Start Recording` then allow the user to talk continuously. Then the frontend will detect if audio from mic is silent for atleast 0.3 seconds. then transcribe the current audio but still continue audio recording in the frontent and only when user press `Stop Recording` to stop recording.
